English:

Gomoku/Wuziqi(五子棋）is a traditional Chinese abstract strategic chess game. I have made both multiplayer 1v1 mode and versus Ai mode for this game

Rules:

Black always plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Key features:

1. There is a versus AI mode in the game, which has 3 difficult levels. "Ruiqi the beast" is the easiest AI, "Ricky Peng" represents the normal difficulty and "Ricky the god" is invincible. Sadly, the AIs are only allowed to play the white side.

2. Whenever there is a player who achieved 5 in a row, the system will automatically announce the winner immediatetly.

3. There are other features including determining whoever goes first, bringing you to an online website in order to train your gomoku's strategic thinkings, and a replay button which allows you to restart your game at any time.

中文:

五子棋就不用我介绍了吧，规则也不用说了吧，大家都懂得，小弟今年高二，渣作各位大神无视即可。。。

特色介绍：

1.本游戏支持Ai对战，有三个难度级别，分别是"Ruiq-the-beast"，也就是最简单，任何人都可以打过的难度，"Ricky-Peng"，也就是普通难度，还有"Ricky-the-god"这个难度是不可能被战胜的，就算你黑棋先手也不可能，至于为什么各位可以下载试试看：）小弟我并没有让AI有使用黑棋的权利，至于为什么，答案就一个字：“懒”。

2.无论谁达到了五子连珠，系统都会直接自动显示谁是胜利者，并且结束比赛。

3.这款软件还有其他的特点，比如说决定哪个人先手（哪个人拿黑子），把你带到可以训练你的五子棋棋艺的网站，以及一个你任何时候都可以使用的重新开始按钮，只要打不顺，那就重新开始吧！
