Gomoku/Wuziqi(五子棋）is a traditional Chinese abstract strategic chess game. I have made both multiplayer 1v1 mode and versus Ai mode for this game

Rules:

Black always plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Key features:

1. There is a versus AI mode in the game, which has 3 difficult levels. "Ruiqi the beast" is the easiest AI, "Ricky Peng" represents the normal difficulty and "Ricky the god" is invincible. Sadly, the AIs are only allowed to play the white side.

2. Whenever there is a player who achieved 5 in a row, the system will automatically announce the winner immediatetly.

3. There are other features including determining whoever goes first, bringing you to an online website in order to train your gomoku's strategic thinkings, and a replay button which allows you to restart your game at any time.
